# Git & GitHub Workflow for GDG PUP Platform

This guide outlines the standard procedures for contributing to the GDG PUP Platform. Adhering to these practices ensures a clean project history, effective collaboration, and high code quality across our monorepo.

---

## Prerequisites

Before contributing, verify you have:

- Git installed and configured (refer to [Setting Up The Project](./0-SettingUpTheProject.md)).
- A GitHub Account with access to the GDG PUP organization.
- The Repository URL for the project you are working on.

---

## The Contribution Cycle

Every feature or fix follows this lifecycle:

1.  Sync: Always start with the latest code from dev.
2.  Branch: Isolate your work in a specific branch.
3.  Code: Implement your changes.
4.  Commit: Save your work with meaningful messages.
5.  Push: Upload your branch to GitHub.
6.  PR: Open a Pull Request for review.
7.  Merge: Once approved, your code joins the main codebase.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
Download the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2. Prepare Your Environment
Ensure your local dev branch is up-to-date before starting anything new:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
```

---

## Branching Strategy

We use strict naming conventions to keep our workspace organized.

### Branch Naming
Format: type/description-slug

| Type | Use Case | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| feat | New features | feat/user-auth-system |
| fix | Bug fixes | fix/mobile-nav-alignment |
| docs | Documentation updates | docs/update-readme |
| refactor | Code restructuring | refactor/api-services |

### Creating a Branch
```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feat/add-achievement-system
```

---

## Committing Your Work

We follow the Conventional Commits specification. This allows us to automatically generate changelogs and version numbers.

### Format
```text
type(scope): description
```

### Common Types
- feat: Adds a new feature.
- fix: Solves a bug.
- docs: Documentation only changes.
- style: Formatting, missing semi-colons, etc. (no code change).
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools.

### Examples
- feat(api): add new endpoint for user profile
- fix(ui): correct button color on dark mode
- docs(onboarding): add guide for git workflow
- test(auth): add unit tests for login service

### Commands
```bash
# Check changed files
git status

# Stage specific files
git add src/app.ts

# ...or stage everything (use carefully)
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "feat(api): implement user achievements"
```

## Pushing & Pull Requests

### 1. Push to GitHub
Upload your local branch to the remote server:

```bash
git push origin feat/add-achievement-system
```
*(If it's your first push, Git may ask you to set the upstream. Just copy the command it provides.)*

### 2. Open a Pull Request (PR)
1.  Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
2.  Click "Compare & pull request".
3.  Set the base branch to dev (never main directly).
4.  Fill out the PR template:
    - Title: Use the conventional commit format (e.g., feat(api): add achievement system).
    - Description: Explain what changed and why.
    - Checklist: Verify you've tested your code.

---

## Review & Merge

1.  Wait for Review: A maintainer will review your code.
2.  Address Feedback: Make any requested changes locally, commit, and push again. The PR updates automatically.
3.  Merge: Once approved, a maintainer will merge your branch into dev.
4.  Current Cleanup: Delete your local feature branch.

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git branch -d feat/add-achievement-system
```

---

## Pro Tips

*   Update Often: Run git pull origin dev regularly in your feature branch to avoid massive merge conflicts later.
*   Small Commits: Make atomic commits. It's easier to undo a small mistake than a massive one.
*   Test Locally: Always run the build and tests (pnpm run test) before pushing. CI/CD will catch failures, but it saves time to catch them yourself.
