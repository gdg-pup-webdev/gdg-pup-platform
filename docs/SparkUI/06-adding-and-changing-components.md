# Adding & Changing Components

Changes to Spark-UI affect all consuming applications.

## Adding a new component

1. Confirm the component belongs in Spark-UI
2. Implement the component
3. Add full Storybook documentation
4. Ensure accessibility considerations are met
5. Export from the package entry point

Components without Storybook documentation are considered incomplete.

## Making changes

- Minor visual changes should be communicated
- Breaking changes require coordination
- Storybook must be updated alongside code changes
