# Introduction

Spark-UI is the shared UI foundation for all frontend applications.

Its goals are to:
- Ensure visual and interaction consistency
- Centralize accessibility and UI behavior
- Reduce duplication and ad-hoc styling
- Provide a stable base for feature development

Applications **compose** Spark-UI components — they do not reimplement them.
