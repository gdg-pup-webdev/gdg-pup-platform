# Coding Guidelines

Welcome to the **GDG PUP Platform Coding Guidelines** – a comprehensive set of standards and best practices designed to maintain code quality, scalability, and consistency across our monorepo. These guidelines empower our team to build maintainable, type-safe applications while fostering effective collaboration.

## 📋 Purpose & Philosophy

Our coding guidelines are built on the following core principles:

- **🎯 Scalability**: Design decisions that support growth and maintainability
- **🔒 Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety through contract-first development
- **🏗️ Architectural Integrity**: Clear separation of concerns with layered architecture
- **🤝 Collaboration**: Consistent workflows for seamless team coordination
- **📖 Self-Documenting Code**: Readable code that explains itself

These guidelines reflect lessons learned and best practices developed specifically for our platform's unique needs.

---

## 🗂️ Organization & Numbering System

Guidelines are organized using a systematic numbering convention: `XYZ`

- **X** = Major category (see below)
- **Y** = Always `0` (separator)
- **Z** = Minor number within category

### Categories

| Category | Number Range | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Backend** | 100-199 | Backend API development standards |
| **Frontend** | 200-299 | Frontend development patterns _(reserved for future use)_ |
| **Contracts** | 300-399 | API contract specifications _(reserved for future use)_ |
| **Project Structure** | 400-499 | File organization and architecture |
| **General Standards** | 500-599 | Universal coding practices |
| **Documentation** | 600-699 | Documentation standards |
| **Collaboration** | 700-799 | Git workflow, PRs, and teamwork |

## 💡 Understanding the Rationale

Each guideline exists to solve specific challenges we've encountered:

- **Contract-First Development** ensures frontend and backend can evolve independently without breaking changes
- **Layered Architecture** decouples database schema from API contracts, allowing flexible refactoring
- **Shallow Routes** keep API endpoints intuitive and maintainable
- **Folder-by-Feature** makes related code easy to find and modify together

When you understand the "why" behind each guideline, you can make better decisions about when to follow them strictly and when to thoughtfully deviate (see **[501 - The Grey Area](./501-TheGreyArea.md)**).

## 🔄 Contributing to Guidelines

These guidelines are living documents. If you identify:

- ❌ Conflicting guidance between guidelines
- 📝 Missing scenarios not covered
- 💡 Better approaches based on experience

Please see **[601 - Updating the Coding Guidelines](./601-UpdatingTheCodingStandards.md)** for how to propose changes.

**Important:** All guideline updates must be documented in **[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)** with author attribution and rationale.
